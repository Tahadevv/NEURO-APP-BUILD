## 🧠 Mental Health Scoring System

### Stress Level (0-100)
- **0-30**: Low stress (Green) - Good mental state
- **31-60**: Moderate stress (Yellow) - Some concerns
- **61-100**: High stress (Red) - Needs attention

### Mental Health Score (0-100)
- **0-30**: Concerning (Red) - Emergency contact shown
- **31-60**: Moderate (Yellow) - Recommendations provided
- **61-100**: Good (Green) - Positive reinforcement

### Depression Risk Assessment
- **Low**: Mental health score > 60, low sadness
- **Moderate**: Mental health score 30-60, moderate sadness
- **High**: Mental health score < 30, high sadness

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
python setup.py  # Installs dependencies and creates .env
python run_server.py  # Starts the server
```

### 2. Frontend Configuration
The frontend has been updated to use the new backend endpoints. The main changes are in `screens/FacialAnalysisScreen.tsx`:

- Updated API endpoint to `http://localhost:8000/emotion/analyze`
